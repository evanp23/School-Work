What is the difference between user mode and kernel mode?

User mode is restricted from accessing hardware directly. This is where all user applications are executed. The
kernel mode has direct access to hardware and maintains control over all resources and the system itself. The core
elements of the operating system are part of the kernel mode.

These two modes correspond to the theory of protection rings for an operating system.
